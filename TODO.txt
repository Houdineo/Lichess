TODO List for Lichess Tournament Analyzer

Functionality Improvements

- Cache tournament fetch responses to reduce API calls (@st.cache_data)
- Handle API rate limiting (HTTP 429) with retry/backoff logic
- Provide a user-friendly error message when rate limited

Code Structure & Maintenance
- Move tournament fetching logic into a separate utility module (utils.py)

UI / UX
- Show a loading spinner while tournaments are being fetched
- Display number of tournaments fetched and time taken
- word for word matching for the tournament names menu capitalization included
- do a combined marathon setting too


Future Ideas
-show best tournaments for each tournament
	- figure out how to calculate "best"
	- maybe add a toggle for recent
- Highlight most-played opponents
- Let users compare multiple usernames side-by-side
- Eventually split Streamlit app into multiple pages or sections.
